I DID NOT UPLOAD THE CSV FILES WHERE I HAVE THE MARKET MINUTE DATA BECAUSE THEY ARE HUGE.
In this project I am developing a backtesting platform with minute data. On the CROSS_SECTIONAL_ALPHAS IN-SAMPLE.py, I generate trading signals with daily candles based on the strategy (I save the strategies on the STRATEGIES folder), and then I put those signals on a minute by minute dataframe from a minute csv file that is not in this repo because its very big. Then I backtest these daily signals with the minute dataframe and I simulate slippage, fees, stop loss, take profit and capital allocation. Here I am trying to find efficient portafolio stratgies that allocate capital to different assets.
My goal is to have a platform that lets me backtest hypostheis or trading strategies accorss many assets that will save me time.
